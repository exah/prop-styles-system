> Design system utils for component based CSS-in-JS libraries


- [x] Support [`emotion`](https://emotion.sh), [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com) and [`glamorous`](https://glamorous.rocks)
- [x] Responsive by default
- [x] Dynamic


## 📦 Install

```sh
$ yarn add pss
```


## 🤔 Why?

Because css-in-js and design systems are all the hype right now! But seriously, we want to: 

- Define our styling system (grid, colors, fonts, sizes, breakpoints, etc.) once and reuse it throughout the project
- Style our components using concise and easy-to-memorize props
- Have a convenient way to define alternative styles for different screen sizes
